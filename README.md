# FluxQon
This repository contains the core classes and functions I wrote to produce the simulations presented in my PhD thesis. Some basic quantum-modelling tools, such as [operator matrix construction](/Operator), [solving unitary time evolution](/+Solve/UTE.m), [solving Lindblad master equation](/+Solve/LME.m), and [calculating radiation spectrum](/Readout/RadiationSpectrum.m), are provided in this repository. Although the codes provided here can be tailored for more general uses, they were written specifically to do quantum simulations of flux qubits, YSO:Er<sup>3+</sup> ions, and combinations of the two. Coupled systems a flux qubit and paramagnetic ions are referred to in the thesis as *flux qons*. A flux qon with YSO:Er<sup>3+</sup> could be used to perform quantum frequency conversions between the microwave and the fiber-optic domain. For more information on the theory and dynamics of flux qons, please refer to [my PhD thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/11343/220532). Some [examples](https://github.com/heriantolim/FluxQon#examples) are given below to show how the codes in this repository can be implemented. These examples are simplified forms of the directives I used to produce the figures contained in my PhD thesis.
